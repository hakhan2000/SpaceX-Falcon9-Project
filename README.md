# SpaceX-Falcon9-Project

Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certification Course.

Acquired and refined Falcon9 launch data to understand factors influencing SpaceX Falcon9 launches and enable competing startups to make informed bids against them. Conducted exploratory analysis using Python, found patterns in data with SQL, and determined labels for training supervised models. Created interactive dashboard for hands-on launch record analysis with Plotly, generated proximity map to analyze launch sites with Folium, and built diverse classification models to determine whether first stage would land successfully.
