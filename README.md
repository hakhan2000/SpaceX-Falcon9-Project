# SpaceX-Falcon9-Project

Capstone Project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certification Course.

SpaceX is able to advertise Falcon9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of roughly 62 million dollars while other providers have an advertising cost that can go up to 165 million dollars. This significant change in overall cost is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.

If we are able to determine whether the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. We can use this information to determine whether an alternate company, SpaceY, will be able to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
